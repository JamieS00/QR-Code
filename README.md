## Overview

This is a project I recreated using HTML and CSS based on the QR Code Component challenge from Frontend Mentor. The goal was to build a clean, centered card that displays a QR code with some text. The layout was straightforward, but I had some difficulty centering the container div and ensuring all elements were properly aligned.

## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

I learned how to center content both vertically and horizontally using Flexbox.  
I also got better at managing spacing with `padding`, `margin`, and setting `max-width` for containers.
